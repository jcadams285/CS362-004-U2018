This is my assignment-4 submission!

I added three new rules to my Makefile: randomtestadventurer, randomtestcard1, and randomtestcard2

These rules will compile and execute the programs.  It will save the info in an .out file.  Each rule has a separate .out file.  I have left the .out files in the folder for you.  If you enter make clean then it will delete these .out files.
